## How to Test and Use

### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. **Access the Application**: Visit the live demo or run locally
2. **Initialize Database**: Click "Initialize Database" in the sidebar to create necessary tables
3. **Import Sample Data**: Click "Import Sample Data" to populate the database with comparison products

### Step 2: Testing Product Analysis

#### Method A: Manual Entry (Recommended for Testing)
1. Navigate to the **"Manual Entry"** tab
2. Enter product details:
   ```
   Title: Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max
   Description: Latest iPhone with titanium design, A17 Pro chip, and advanced camera system
   Price: 1199
   Brand: Apple
   ```
3. Click **"Analyze Product"** to see the AI analysis

#### Method B: Amazon URL Analysis
1. Go to the **"Amazon URL"** tab
2. Paste a valid Amazon product URL (e.g., `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QDHRTT`)
3. Click **"Analyze Product"**
   - Note: Amazon's anti-bot protection may limit URL scraping

### Step 3: Understanding Results

#### Risk Indicator System
The application displays a **color-coded risk assessment**:

- **ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK (0.0-0.3)**: Highly Authentic - Strong authenticity indicators
- **ðŸ”µ MODERATE RISK (0.3-0.5)**: Likely Authentic - Minor concerns detected  
- **ðŸŸ¡ ELEVATED RISK (0.5-0.7)**: Potentially Suspicious - Proceed with caution
- **ðŸŸ  HIGH RISK (0.7-0.85)**: Likely Counterfeit - Strong risk indicators
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL RISK (0.85-1.0)**: Highly Suspicious - Avoid this product

#### Analysis Components
1. **Authenticity Score**: Numerical risk assessment (0-1 scale)
2. **Risk Level Badge**: Color-coded risk category
3. **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of risk level
4. **Detailed Reasoning**: AI explanation of the assessment
5. **Similar Products**: Comparison with verified products in database

### Step 4: Testing Different Scenarios

#### Test Case 1: Authentic Product
```
Title: Apple MacBook Air M2
Description: 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
Price: 1099
Brand: Apple
```
*Expected: LOW to MODERATE risk level*

#### Test Case 2: Suspicious Product
```
Title: Aple iPhone 15 Pro (note misspelling)
Description: Cheap iPhone with all features
Price: 99
Brand: Aple
```
*Expected: HIGH to CRITICAL risk level*

#### Test Case 3: Luxury Item Test
```
Title: Rolex Submariner Watch
Description: Luxury Swiss watch with automatic movement
Price: 500
Brand: Rolex
```
*Expected: HIGH risk due to unusually low price*

### Step 5: Interpreting AI Analysis

The system evaluates products based on:
- **Price Analysis**: Comparison with typical market prices
- **Brand Consistency**: Spelling and authenticity of brand names
- **Description Quality**: Professional vs. suspicious language patterns
- **Similarity Matching**: Comparison with verified authentic products
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of common counterfeit indicators

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **URL Analysis Fails**: Use Manual Entry instead due to Amazon's anti-scraping measures
- **No Similar Products Found**: Import sample data first to populate comparison database
- **Database Errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL is properly configured with vector extension

**Getting Accurate Results:**
1. Always initialize the database before first use
2. Import sample data to improve comparison accuracy
3. Test with both obviously authentic and suspicious products
4. Review the detailed reasoning to understand AI decision-making

## Database Setup

For production deployment, you'll need a PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

## Configuration

Update `config.yaml` with your specific settings:
- Database connection details
- LLM model preferences
- Application settings
